# Z-Butt
## An Artisan keycap creation platform.

Print these using whichever service or printer you find that produces very high resolution prints.
I prefer Shapeways Smoothest Fine Detail Plastic option for Z-Butt-1U-P1 V3.stl, and any other option for the other two.

Description of use:

### Z-Butt-1U-P1 V4.stl 
    Is used to create the silicone mold that gives your keycap its butt (Stem included).
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-P2 v4 or Z-Butt-1U-P2.
    
   
### Z-Butt-1U-P2 V4.stl
    Can be used to sculpt a 1U artisan keycap out of your preffered medium (I use Epoxy clay, vaseline, and a brush).
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-P1 v4.
    
    
### Z-Butt-1U-P2.stl
    Can be used to copy any 1U keycap.
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-P1 v4.
