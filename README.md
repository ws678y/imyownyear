# Z-Butt
An Artisan keycap creation platform.

Print these using whichever service or printer you find that produces very high resolution prints.
I prefer Shapeways Smoothest Fine Detail Plastic option for Z-Butt-1U-P1 V3.stl, and any other option for the other two.

Description of use:

Z-Butt-1U-P1 V3.stl 
    Is used to create the silicone mold that gives your keycap its butt (Stem included).
   
Z-Butt-1U-P2 V3.stl
    Can be used to sculpt a 1U artisan keycap out of your preffered medium (I use Epoxy clay, vaseline, and a brush).
    
Z-Butt-1U-P2.stl
    Can be used to copy any 1U keycap.
