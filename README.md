Description of use:

### Z-Butt-1U-stem-cavity V4.stl 
    Is used to create the silicone mold that gives your keycap its butt (Stem included).
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-sculpting-base.
    
   
### Z-Butt-1U-sculpting-base V4.stl
    Can be used to sculpt a 1U artisan keycap out of your preffered medium (I use Epoxy clay, vaseline, and a brush).
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-stem-cavity.
    
    
### Z-Butt-1U-master-base V4-WithBase.stl
    Can be used to copy any 1U keycap.
    
    This is to be used with Z-Butt-1U-stem-cavity.
